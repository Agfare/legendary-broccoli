A simple script checking for integers in XLS files before converting them to PO
# why
Once we spent a couple of hours trying to find faulty strings in an Excel file of 27000 strings. Before converting this file to PO, we had to eliminate all strings that contained a source text and integers instead of target texts. A CheckInteger was born.
# how-to
1. Open console
2. Run ```python checkinteger.py```
3. Choose the file in a dialog window
4. Enjoy
